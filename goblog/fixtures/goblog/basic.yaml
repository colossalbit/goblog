           What's the deal with Sagman, Bennett, Robbins, Oppenheim and 
           Taff? I mean, what's the deal already? Does a company really need so 
           many names? I think the answer to our problem lies in a stakeout. We 
           just stakeout the office. I know where it is--midtown.
