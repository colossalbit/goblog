    brief: |
        <p>
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
        conversation?'

        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
        conversation?'
        </p><p>
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
        of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.
        </p><p>
        There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
        VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
        Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
        occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
        it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
        OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
        Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
        never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
        to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
        after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
        rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        </p><p>
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
        in the world she was to get out again.
        </p><p>
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
        well.
        </p><p>
        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
        plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
        going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
        she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
        looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
        she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
        of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
        she fell past it.

        <p>
        It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
        anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
        it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
        my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
        ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
        moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
        and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
        nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
        the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
        had vanished completely.

        had vanished completely.
        </p>
        <p>
        Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
        called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
        out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
        Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
        in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
        had made.
        </p><p>
        'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
        surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
        his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
        came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
        plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
        knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
        real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
        fan and gloves.
        </p><p>
        'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
        a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
        began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
        here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
        nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
        think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
        began ordering people about like that!'
        </p><p>
        By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
        in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
        of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
        and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
        bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
        with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
        to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
        to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
        this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
        I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'

        It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
        arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
        how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
        the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
        great hurry.
        </p><p>
        An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
        feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
        said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
        she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
        hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
        all her coaxing.

        hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
        all her coaxing.
        </p><p>
        Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
        held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
        all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
        and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
        to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
        other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
        over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
        very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
        moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
        the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
        little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
        all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
        its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
        </p><p>
        This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
        set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
        till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
        </p><p>
        'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
        against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
        leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
        only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
        I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
        suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
        question is, what?'
        </p><p>
        The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
        the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
        looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
        There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
        herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
        behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
        was on the top of it.
